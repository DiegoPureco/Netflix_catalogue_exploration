# Netflix_Catalogue_Exploration_And_Visualization

This data analysis project focuses on the quality of the Netflix catalog, as determined by the ratings of movies and TV shows on IMDB. To conduct this analysis, I first explored the catalog using SQL, utilizing a variety of functions such as joins, CTEs, window functions, and aggregate functions. Additionally, I created views and updated the database to optimize my exploration of the data. After examining the catalog and identifying the most useful data, I built a Power BI dashboard to visualize the ratings of Netflix content.

During my exploration, I investigated the number of productions available on Netflix and the breakdown between movies and TV shows. I also examined the ratings of these productions on IMDB to determine the average score and distribution of ratings. By studying this data, I was able to identify several interesting trends and patterns, including the most highly rated genres and the distribution of ratings among movies and TV shows.

The findings of this analysis provide valuable insights into the quality of the Netflix catalog and help to identify areas of strength and weakness in the platform's content offerings. This information can be used to inform future content acquisition and production strategies, as well as help subscribers make more informed viewing choices. Ultimately, the goal of this analysis is to provide a comprehensive overview of the quality of the Netflix catalog and to identify opportunities for improvement.
